          "sectionDescription": "This series of paintings were made during the first lockdown in 2020. Restricted to stay indoors, these works marked the physical urge and immediate impulse to act on the leftover oil paint from my father’s palette, an act unlike any made by me in the past. (Or atleast I felt so in that moment) This paint was then translated as landscapes or in other words mindscapes on old and used pieces of canvas from my college days, a mundane material for any artist, found while doing household chores.           The paintings are intuitive fragments of memory, the self probably yearning for a utopian world, outside of Covid, its uncertainty and its reality. They symbolise hope, a sense of respite and relief in the mind’s eye. The works attempt at creating an aesthetic, a feeling of beauty from the purposeless, in order to create meaning and purpose.",

After several attempts at salvaging my painting, it seemed like the piece could not embody anything else, and preferred to remain as it is! Impulsively, I used the paint to create these sketches instead. The broken fragment is a part of the Memory Garden now. ",

While emotions are broadly categorised, there are a range of transitory feelings that we are not able to understand psychologically. Like an observer of an onion, the gestures of a hand and natural terrains, I have tried to uncover and simultaneously depict the layers of gray within our transitory feelings, yet unable to fully match the word with the visual!",

The act of rolling, squeezing, dabbing, pouring and dripping became significant to me, as they implied that I was doing something: the expressionist tendency towards which I leaned, was new to me at the time. &nbsp;      The works served as instant intuitive urges, while I worked on multiple canvases at once. Even though I did not have an end image in mind, I observed that subconsciously, the works often resembled nature, at the point where I decided to stop painting further. It was probably a way through which I could escape my conscious mind, simultaneously have the satisfaction of doing something and attempt to find meaning through the process (atleast try to!). &nbsp; None of the paintings in the series exist anymore (apart from Haze). They were reused/ recycled as other works.",
