          "sectionDescription": "This series of paintings were made during the first lockdown in 2020. Restricted to stay indoors, these works marked the physical urge and immediate impulse to act on the leftover oil paint from my father’s palette, an act unlike any made by me in the past. (Or atleast I felt so in that moment) This paint was then translated as landscapes or in other words mindscapes on old and used pieces of canvas from my college days, a mundane material for any artist, found while doing household chores.           The paintings are intuitive fragments of memory, the self probably yearning for a utopian world, outside of Covid, its uncertainty and its reality. They symbolise hope, a sense of respite and relief in the mind’s eye. The works attempt at creating an aesthetic, a feeling of beauty from the purposeless, in order to create meaning and purpose.",

After several attempts at salvaging my painting, it seemed like the piece could not embody anything else, and preferred to remain as it is! Impulsively, I used the paint to create these sketches instead. The broken fragment is a part of the Memory Garden now. ",

This series is a take on this routine exercise, attempting to comprehend simple (yet complex) feelings through visual connotations. While emotions are broadly categorised, there are a range of transitory feelings that we are not able to understand psychologically. Like an observer of an onion, the gestures of a hand and natural terrains, I have tried to uncover and simultaneously depict the layers of gray within our transitory feelings, yet unable to fully match the word with the visual!",

The painting embodies this particular memory along with the many other memories of my visits to Lal Bagh with my mother, as a child. <br> The painting was gifted to a friend. ",

The leftover food was composted in ‘Matkas’, turning this guilt into matter. <br> The exchanges were playful, most of my classmates being aware of my habit of not wanting to waste food. A few of them were: ‘Main apne paapo ka pashchataap kar raha hoon’ (I am undergoing penance for my sins) ‘Idhar ka khana acha nahi hai, isliye zyaada phikta hai’ (The food here is not good and so it gets wasted more) ‘Nimbu, achaar aur hari mirch sabse taken for granted hote hain. Sabse zyaada yehi phikte hain’ (Lemon, pickle and green chillies are most taken for granted and therefore wasted) <br> The works are symbolic of value and the constant intermingling of permanence and impermanence. <br> 15 of 30 works exist. The remaining are now part of the project: Burial.",

They translate into a play of form, colour and texture in this series. Having taken printmaking as a subsidiary subject during my BFA, I observed that a lot of PVC ink was wasted during the time. <br> It was the first time where I began treating the ink (or paint) as a *material* and not a *medium*. In addition, the materials began to physically manifest on my works, instead of them being mere tools to create impressions/ textures. The surficial tensions and layers were built through the act of rolling, squeezing, dabbing, pouring, dripping etc (like in the former series: Haze), where in I let the various wasted materials in the studio speak to me. The works symbolize various states of being or in other words existence through different kinds of movements and tensions. ",

Even though I did not have an end image in mind, I observed that subconsciously, the works often resembled *nature*, at the point where I decided to stop painting further. It was probably a way through which I could escape my conscious mind, simultaneously have the satisfaction of *doing something* and attempt to find meaning through the process (atleast try to!).  ",

This time-lapse of the decay process of my own eaten apple captures the transition of decay over a period of 2 1/2 months. It is a result of my curiosity after observing a number of half-eaten apple cores in the university campus. When something decays, the process is a slow transformation of a certain kind of shrinkage, with an eventual probability of leading to *nothing*. As I realised that life and death co-existed hand in hand, the uneaten core seemed like a metaphor for a skeleton/carcass.
