          "projectDescription": "Thought Diaries is a series of works which were created post Lockdown 1.0. As disparate works, they are an amalgamation of floating thoughts in the moment, combined with an attempt to understand transitory feelings. My own personal experiences along with objects that I observed in my daily routine have been translated as paintings and sketches/ drawings."

        "projectHeader": "Roller Paintings",
        "projectDescription": "These works arose from the need to use worn out tools, which I found in my studio during BFA: a roller that had lost its elasticity to spread paint and a squeegee that had a damaged rubber surface. The act of rolling, squeezing, dabbing, pouring and dripping became significant to me, as they implied that I was doing something: the expressionist tendency towards which I leaned, was new to me at the time. &nbsp;      The works served as instant intuitive urges, while I worked on multiple canvases at once. Even though I did not have an end image in mind, I observed that subconsciously, the works often resembled nature, at the point where I decided to stop painting further. It was probably a way through which I could escape my conscious mind, simultaneously have the satisfaction of doing something and attempt to find meaning through the process (atleast try to!). &nbsp; None of the paintings in the series exist anymore (apart from Haze). They were reused/ recycled as other works."
